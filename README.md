TankGame
========

A 3D multiplayer tank battle game written entirely in JavaScript.

## Running the client

Open `client/index.html` in your WebGL capable browser. You'll have to run a simple webserver or enable local file access to load the models. See [How to run things locally][Run locally].

[Run locally]: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally


## Starting a server

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) installed
2. Do a `npm install` inside of `server/`
3. Run `node server/index.js`
